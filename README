This library is going to provide cffi bindings and a lispy interface
to Tokyo Cabinet[1]

* Warning:
  - Code is for now highly experimental. The lisp API is not yet decided
  - I would not use Tokyo Cabinet for anything but playing, becasue
    there is no way to contact the developer, and no way to send in
    patches or bug reports. Therefore use couchdb or mongodb instead.


* KNOWN BUGS 

** When building tctdb-sys.lisp (which you probably don't do anyway)
   the line containing (TDBFFATAL #.HDBFFATA)) must be changed to
   (TDBFFATAL #.HDBFFATAL)) There is an L missing. 
   Must be a bug in swig

** cl-store
   The code I tried to create that uses cl-store does not work. I have
   problem understanding how to convert from and to-foreign.
