This library is going to provide cffi bindings and a lispy interface
to Tokyo Cabinet[1]

Warning:
Code is for now highly experimental

Please send suggestions and comments to 
Knut Olav BÃ¸hmmer <bohmer@gmail.com>

Note 

* It's not straight forward to store objects with tcget-vector and
  restore them with tcget, even when keys are string. It does not look
  to me as the reasen is that strings are 0-terminated, vectors are
  not (I think). I don't know the reason. 

KNOWN BUGS 

* When building tctdb-sys.lisp (which you probably don't do anyway)
  the line containing (TDBFFATAL #.HDBFFATA)) must be changed to
  (TDBFFATAL #.HDBFFATAL)) There is an L missing. 
  Must be a bug in swig
