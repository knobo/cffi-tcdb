This is a project to learn more about Tokyo Cabinet and CFFI

Update: looks like I'll make the whole library. For two reasons
1. I'll use it in production, and I can not rely on others to do the work
2. I whant the library to be LGPL


The code relies on cl-store, flexi-stream and cl-tc

The plan is to build a more lispy interface on top of cl-tc that on
it's current state is just cffi bindings to the tokyo cabinet library.

If the code turns out OK, I hope that parts of it could be merged in
to cl-tc so that it becomes a fully functional lisp library for Tokyo
Cabinet.
