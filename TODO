TODO:

* Have to write testes for every function

* Make sure we don't leek memory.

DONE:

* The function mk-vec must be rewritten to handle utf-8 characters
  This is maybe done by allocating something else than :char
  And maybe doing something else then string-to-octets.
  For example (map 'vector char-code)

* rename mk-vec function to "string to vector" (or something), 
  and make sure that it always receives a string.
